## 📈 Growth & Evaluation

Promotions from **Programmer → Veteran → Captain** are based on:
- Completion of required learning modules  
- Demonstrated technical skill and reliability  
- Leadership, communication, and mentorship abilities  

> “Leadership is not about being in charge. It’s about taking care of those in your charge.”  
> — Simon Sinek

As team members grow in responsibility, technical skill alone is not enough.  
**Trust, communication, and character are just as essential** to becoming a leader on Team 5804. That’s why all programmers are expected to uphold the following shared values and behaviours:
