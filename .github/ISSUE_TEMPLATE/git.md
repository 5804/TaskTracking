## ðŸŽ¯ Description

Git is a version control system that helps teams manage and track changes to their code. In this task, you'll practice using Git for basic operations like cloning, branching, committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.

## ðŸ“‚ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up SSH access for your GitHub account. Use the [Git set up SSH key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X40b9x9BFGo) reference to assist.
- [ ] Clone the TaskTracking repo to your computer.
- [ ] Create a new branch using your name.
- [ ] Add and commit a file under `/Student/{yourFullNameInCamelCase}/README.md` in this repo. 
  - This README.md file should contain an image you create to introduce yourself to the rest of the team. See [Gavin's GitHub README](https://github.com/gavinjalberghini/gavinjalberghini) for inspiration.  
- [ ] Push the commit to your branch.
- [ ] Create a file named `config` under `/Student/{yourFullNameInCamelCase}/`
  - This file is your SSH config to be loaded onto the programming laptops. Watch the video named [Git setting up SSH access for multiple users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwD3e1BZ5Y) for information about how to set up this file and how it will be used. 
- [ ] Create a pull request from your push.
- [ ] Ask a mentor to review your pull request

## ðŸ““ Notes
- When pushing to a remote branch, a link to generate the corresponding pull request will appear on your console.
- GitHub in the command line no longer accepts passwords. You will need to use an access token in place of your password. Please follow the GitHub Access token tutorial above to learn how.
