# Title (The name of the new SOP)

## Purpose (Why do we have this SOP? What do we gain by completing this procedure?)

## Agents (Who is involved in completing this SOP? Usually, competition SOPs will require more collaboration.)

## Procedure (What needs to be done to complete the task? Think of this as something similar to acceptance criteria, except you should be demonstrating through both instruction and visuals how to accomplish the procedure.)
