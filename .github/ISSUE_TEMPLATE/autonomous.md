## ðŸŽ¯ Description

This ticket is a quick introduction on how to use PathPlanner and Choreo to write autonomous paths.

## ðŸ“‚ Acceptance Criteria
- Read the appropriate sections of the [PathPlanner docs](https://pathplanner.dev/gui-editing-paths-and-autos.html) and understand what the following do and when to use them.
  - [ ]  Waypoints
  - [ ]  Event markers
  - [ ]  Rotation targets
  - [ ]  Global constraints
  - [ ]  Constraint zones
  - [ ]  Path optimizer
  - [ ]  Path vs auto in PathPlanner
-  Create a path and auto utilizing all of the features above in PathPlanner. The path doesn't have to have a purpose or do anything specific.

- Read the appropriate sections of the [Choreo docs](https://choreo.autos/usage/editing-paths/)  and understand what the following do and when to use them.
  - [ ]  Pose, translation, and empty waypoints
  - [ ]  Constraint zone types
    - [ ] Max velocity vs. max acceleration
    - [ ] Max acceleration vs. max angular acceleration
    - [ ] Stop points
  - [ ] Event markers
  - [ ] Generating and saving paths
-  Create a path utilizing all of the features above in Choreo. The path doesn't have to have a purpose or do anything specific.
